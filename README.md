# SaveYourMoney<br/>
This is an app I created in order to keep track of how I'm spending my money and how much can I save each month. It's a Python web app that uses Flask for authentication and database management. I used BS4 as HTML and CSS framework for the looks of the web app, a bit of jinja and a bit of JS. For piecharts I used the Google Charts tools.<br/>

How it works:
You create an account or login your existing account.<br/>

You add tags (categories) from your expenses and incomes. Using these tags you can add expenses and incomes so everything will be nice and organized.<br/>

On the dashboard you can see piecharts that describe your financial situation. <br/>
