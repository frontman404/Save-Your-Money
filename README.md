# Save Your Money<br/>
This is an web application I made in order to keep track of how I'm spending my money and how much can I save each month. It's a Python web app that uses Flask for authentication and database management. I used BS4 as HTML and CSS framework for the looks of the web app, a bit of jinja and a bit of JS. For piecharts I used the Google Charts tools.<br/>
